		<h1>Space Marines</h1>
		<h2>Towering men with absolute loyalty to the Emperor</h2>
	</header>

	<main>
		<h3>Background and Playstyle</h3>
		<p>Originally created by the Emperor in the distant M30, they were split into 20 chapters. After the Horus Heresy, they were split into smaller chapters, forming the 10 remaining loyalist chapters and multiple successor chapters. These men (this is an all-male organisation) receive extremely harsh training and go through a ruthless selection program even before they become full battle brothers. While having small numbers they are genetically enhanced to posess extraordinary strength and survivability, at the cost of any possible sociablility. There are legends that a single company of marines can cleanse an entire planet, while the whole chapter moving out is the deadliest force in the galaxy.
			<br>
		Space Marines are masters of combat, but prefer close and medium ranged combat. Due to their great strength they have little effort wielding heavy weapons and armour, but due to their towering figures they are poor stealth fighters. This does not mean that they cannot move about the forest unseen, but it poses a greater challenge for them than for trained assassins. They also follow a certain code of honour based upon the Codex Astartes, that while being somewhat different for each chapter, still decrees honourable fighting strategies rather than stealth missions.
		</p>
		<h3>Military Structure</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Chapter: led by a chapter master, has around a thousand battle brothers split into 10 battle companies. Includes librarians (lore keepers and psykers) and chaplains (spiritual leaders) that are not assigned to particular companies</li>
			<li>Battle Company: led by a captain, each having around a 100 brothers. Usually has a terminator squad, a scout squad, several devastator and  squads and the rest are regular squads. Has its own vehicles and operates independantly of other companies at the command of the chapter master</li>
			<li>Squad: led by a sargeant, has 10 battle brothers. The scout squad is where recent recruits are first stationed, while the terminator squad is the captain's retinue and is the best of the best</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Available chapters</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Ultramarines: loyal followers of the Codex Astartes, this chapter is well known for its raised resistance to the Ruinous Powers and the Warp while its librarians benefit from the tutelage of Chief Librarian Tigurius, gaining more power than others of the same rank</li>
			<li>Space Wolves: mighty warriors from a frozen world they have increased resistance to frost environments and have always been fabled for their hunting skills</li>
			<li>White Scars: these Space Marines are acclaimed to be the best swordsmen of all the chapters, dealing greater damage with all bladed weapons and wielding them with great accuracy</li>
			<li>Salamanders: as their name suggests these marines are highly resistant to fiery environments and have greater endurance due to their punishing prayers</li>
			<li>Dark Angels: being the first Legion created by the Emperor, these warriors have perfected ranged combat, being adept at using assault rifles</li>
		</ul>

			<div>
				<h3>Scout Marine</h3>
				<p>A trainee battle brother, is under obserbvation for any deficiencies in training or genetic modifications.</p>
				<p>Proficient in assault rifles, pistols, daggers and swords.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Space Marine</h3>
				<p>A full member of the chapter after several years spent in the scout company, he is very adept in many forms of combat in many environments.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Space Marine Sargeant</h3>
				<p>As the one in charge of a squad, he has good tactical understanding of the battlefield and can sometimes be required to act independantly of the rest of the company for prolonged periods of time.</p>
				<p>+1 Strength</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Lexicanium</h3>
				<p>If a battle brother is found to posess psyker powers he is separated from others and is given special training. Also, as a librarian of the chapter, even if at the lowest rank, he posesses greater knowledge of the world and  its history.</p>
				<p>Lose proficiency in assault rifles, gain proficiency in staves and spears. Psyker Path</p>
				<p>+1 Intelligence</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Terminator</h3>
				<p>Few marines are given the honour of becoming a terminator, an elite warrior even by Space Marine standards. Can be either a part of the assault terminator squad, which specialise in close combat, or a part of heavy terminator squad, specialising in the usage of heavy weapons.</p>
				<p>Gain Proficiency in hammers and heavy weapons.</p>
				<p>+1 Strength</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Chaplain</h3>
				<p>These are the keepers of order in the chapter, with duties ranging from punishment and interrogation, to morale boosting. They have higher resistance to warp powers and can sometimes channel their faith in the emperor through their staves of power.</p>
				<p>Lose proficiency in assault rifles, gain proficiency in hammers.</p>
				<p>+2 Warp Resistance</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Codicer</h3>
				<p>A librarian that is a more powerful psyker and is more knowledgeable of the chapter's deeds, the codicer can offer valuable advice to the captains when out on a mission with them. Sometimes they get command over a squad of marines if they require to go on a solo mission away from the company.</p>
				<p>+1 Intelligence</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Captain</h3>
				<p>As the leader of a company, the captain has great tactical and strategical knowledge accumulated over several centuries of service. He answers only to a few men in the whole chapter and is expected to be autonomous in many aspects, as he is given missions to cleanse planets and defeat many xenos, heretics and other enemies of the Imperium. The captain is generally in command of the terminator squad, and is expected to lead all his brothers into battle.</p>
				<p>+2 Strength</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Reclusiarch</h3>
				<p>As the senior chaplain in the chapter, this man is invaluable. Being extraordinarily resilient to the warp and a master of combat, he is a very powerful foe to all on the field of battle. Sometimes, the reclusiarch has enough authority to command even the captain, given a good enough reason, and hence whenever he joins the company a terminator squad accompanies him to battle.</p>
				<p>+1 Warp Reistance</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Epistolary</h3>
				<p>Often this is the senior librarian in the chapter, as in order to become the Chief Librarian vast powers ar needed, and not every generation can produce such brothers. These men have accumulated vast knowledge and offer invaluable advice to the chapter master. Due to their value they have a terminator squad guarding them in the thick of battle.</p>
				<p>+2 Intelligence</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Grey Knight</h3>
				<p>This is a sperate order of Space Marines, with gene seed originating from the Emperor Himself. They are fierce, loyal and deadly, all posessing some capacity for spell use. Rarely do they accept any in their ranks, and a marine needs to be a powerful librarian to even be considered. They posess even higher resistance to the Warp and Chaos, and are only called upon in only the direst of needs, for their chapter is small.</p>
				<p>+1 Intelligence AND Warp Resistance</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Dreadnaught</h3>
				<p>Death is sometimes not the end for the most valiant of space marines. When the marine is close to death and cannot be saved by normal means their remains can sometimes be placed inside a special sarcophagus inside a dreadnaught. This way the battle brother can once more venture forth into battle, but this time inside a powerful walker machine armed with deadly heavy weapons.</p>
