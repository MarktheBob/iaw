	</header>

	<main>
		<h3>General Guidelines</h3>
		<p>This is a game that is designed to initially play like a normal D&amp;D game, each person controlling their own character to achieve some mission objective. However towards the higher ranks the tactical thinking needed for the missions gives way to strategy as each player needs to coordinate squads of NPC's to complete the mission objective. Eventually at Rank 5 players will need to coordinate several thousand NPC's in a campaign, along with vehicles and air support. That does not mean that Rank 5's cannot go out on solo missions! For example the players can be sent to retrieve one of the legendary artifacts on a remote world. Initially they would plan the strategy for a battle that would defeat the defending enemies, spearheading the assault to then do a mission of just the players into the holding vault to retrieve the artifact.</p>
		<p>The equipment for players is designed to give them the option to either improve their own stats or outfit their subordinates. For example, will they choose to purchase a Legendary level staff for their psyker character, or get extended mags for bolters for their subordinate squad of marines? Of course players will be allocated funds in order to equip their troops, but they would have to decide on how to divide the money between themselves and their troops and vehicles. Of course, it would be very wise to investigate what would be needed for a mission prior to spending money and time buying everything. After all, if you invest into heavy anti-tank weaponry and you get sent against a huge tyranid swarm full of small gaunts, you will very quickly die.</p>
		<p>Here is a quick ummary of the races. Space Marines are towering close and mid range warriors with some great psyker builds, but are not agile nor diplomatic in any shape or form. Adeptus Sororitas are tall female close combat warriors with some good heavy weapon and fast assault builds, but having agility and long range problems. Eldar have good specialisation, excellent psykers and excell at agile combat, but cannot be bogged down and tank. Tau are great mid and long range combatants with diplomacy thrown in, but cannot be allowed within melee distance. The Guardsmen (and women) are your multi-purpose people that resemble bards, but are quite fragile.</p>
		<p>All character combinations in a group of players are permitted and encouraged. They can either all go for variety, having a close combat Space Marine, two mid-range Tau and Dire avenger players, an Imperial Vindicare Assasin for long range support and an Eldar Seer. But also a team of Tau Scouts, Eldar Rangers and Vindicare Assasins is equally possible. The DM would have to tailor the playthrough accordingly, as it is not fun for a long range sniper team to be sent into a jungle world to battle orks in close quarters. But also it would be rather pointless to send in a mixed team to retrieve the Unique heavy anti-personnel weapon Maugetar when the only Eldar is a Seer and none of the team have a proficiency in heavy weapons.</p>
		<p>I would recommend that all characters level up simultaneously, not based on the XP they obtain, but on the number of missions they have completed. This is especially so when the Rank threshold is neared, as the party should be kept at the same rank. This is intentional, and the reasoning is outlined further on. Therefore if you see someone lagging behind in levels when going on an XP based progression, do allow them to catch up as otherwise the game would be really easy to either cheese or turn unfun.</p>
		<p>I have intentionally made the stats so different between ranks, as according to the lore of the universe a Space Marine Captain (Rank 5) is capable of easily blowing away dozens, if not hundreds of regular cultists (Rank 2 equivalent) without taking even a single point of damage. It should be noted that one character can be killed by several NPC's of a single rank below them, but that is a questionable situation and should be reserved for boss encounters where the NPC is a single rank above the player group. Hence the players should not encounter a situation where they are pitted against several high ranking enemies, as they will easily die, nor should the mission objective be to kill a small group of very low ranking NPC's. The same holds true when the player group is of different ranks. Either the higher ranked characters will steamroll through the enemies leaving almost nothing for the underranked comrade, or the lower ranked player will quickly find themselves dealing almost no damage while getting nearly instakilled.</p>
		<p>Overall, pick and choose what you want to play as, try to stay in character - please don't dump all skill points into strength for a Tau warrior, as the campaign would be oriented towards your class rather than your build. Also, be careful not to put any Pariahs (Culexus assasins, solitaires) alongside psykers, as they will for certain clash and dampen each other's powers.</p>
		<p>Please note that this is merely based upon the lore of the franchise! Do not expect me to follow every bit of official lore, as otherwise it is impossible for this game to work. Some races have been altered slightly, while others underwent some significant changes in order to fit into the game. Also, standard D&amp;D fans will recognise deviations from the regular gameplay, as well as how character creation, level up and stats work. Again, I believe this is the sacrifice that needs to be made for the game to work. If you have any suggestions on how the game can be bettered, please do not hesitate to contact me!</p>
		<p>Going forward, I will work on Rank 6 characters, which will be very very OP, but will also have to complete very very challenging missions. This will be far into the future though, so for now just explore what is here.</p>
			<br>
		<h3>Stats</h3>
		<p>In the game, unless otherwise stated, round in the worst way possible, against the players</p>
		<p>Each character gaines a single stat point every level! Also, follow the individual bonuses as you rank up and do not forget about the bonus stats for each race.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Strength: how much bonus damage can you inflict per each successful melee hit (0.5*Strength) + how accurate can you hit targets</li>
			<li>Constitution: how much health and environmental resistance do you have - base health for all characters = 6 + (constitution stat*2)</li>
			<li>Marksmanship: how easy is it to land a ranged shot and how the weapon handles when used to hit targets outside of the normal weapon range</li>
			<li>Agility: how difficult it is to see you, and how easy it is to land and dodge melee hits (and ranged projectiles if the correct perk is trained in)</li>
			<li>Intelligence: what spells can you learn and how well can you hit distanced targets</li>
			<li>Charisma: how morale affects and is affected by you and how easily speech checks pass</li>
			<li>Warp Resistance: resistance to spells and the influence from the Ruinous Powers</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Skills</h3>
		<p>Character traits that are affected by player stats.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Corruption: affects the use of some items and how you are perceived by some characters. 0 = complete pureness, 100 = a direct agent of the Chaos Gods. Changed by interactions with items, characters and some events. Is sometimes affected by Warp Resistance</li>
			<li>Knowledge: affects interactions, scenarios and many other things. Has 4 branches: xenos (alien organisms), warp (spellcraft and other warp knowledge), history (affects some interactions and some perception checks), geography (landscape and campaign planning). Can only be increased in the shops.</li>
			<li>Perception: the ability to notice things in the surroundings. Affected by Intelligence</li>
			<li>Melee Accuracy: the ability to land hits in close combat, affected by Agility and Strength</li>
			<li>Ranged Accuracy: the ability to hit a ranged target, affected by Marksmanship</li>
			<li>Dodge: the ability to evade from close combat damage, can function as acrobatics affected by Agility</li>
			<li>Elemental Resistance (fire, frost, lightning): the ability to resist damage from the environment and spells, affected by Constitution and Warp Resistance</li>
			<li>Stealth: the ability to go by unseen, affected by Agility</li>
			<li>Diplomacy: the ability to convince other characters to your point of view, affected by Charisma and Intelligence</li>
			<li>Leadership: the ability to inspire others, as well as how you affect and are affected by morale. Affected by Charisma</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Rarity grades</h3>
		<p>I have divided the weapons and armoures available for players into five categories. There are no limits on what character can have, but the general guideline is that Rank 1 players whould have all Common items, with 1-2 Uncommons, while Rank 5 players whould have mostly Unique gear.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Common (C): cheap items that can be bought pretty much everywhere, are the cheapest in the game.</li>
			<li>Uncommon (U): slightly better items that the normal soldiers do not have access to. Cheap-ish.</li>
			<li>Rare (R): items that only officers use, they are rather expensive, but have quite good stats</li>
			<li>Legendary (L): items that are very hard to aquire and are exclusive to high ranking officers, they are among the best money can buy</li>
			<li>Unique (Q): extraordinarily rare or even one-of-a-kind items that few even know exist, let alone are able to wield.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Weapon Proficiency</h3>
		<p>While it is true that you are allowed to equip any weapon in the game, it should be evident that an Eldar Seer should not be weilding a heavy flamer. Likewise, Tau scouts have no need for an enchanted wraithbone staff. While funny, the game will be very quickly over as the players struggle to controll their weapons. Moreover, some of the highlevel gear has stat requirements, so it would be impossible to even equip it. Hence, please heed the proficiencies, as otherwise death would be quite swift. However, should the need arise, you may equip weapons that you have reduced penalties in, as it will probably save your life. As an example, the Tau Scouts have no choice when engaged in close combat than to pull out knives in which they take lower penalties than with swords.</p>
		<p>On a Nat 1 rolled, melee weapons deal regular damage to self/closest ally, ranged weapons and spells deal regular damage to furthest ally in range.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Melee non-proficient: -5 Strength, -5 Agility when equipped. If below Nat 5 is rolled on accuracy, hit closest for normal damage</li>
			<li>Melee reduced penalty: -2 Strength, -2 Agility when equipper. If below Nat 5 is rolled, hit closest ally for half damage</li>
			<li>Ranged non-proficiency: -5 Marksmanship, -10m effective range when equipped. If below Nat 5 is rolled on accuracy, hit furthest ally in range for regular damage</li>
			<li>Ranged reduced proficiency: -2 Marksmanship when equipped. If below Nat 5 is rolled on accuracy, hit furthest ally in range for half damage</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Perks and Skill Courses</h3>
		<p>Rather than have characters earn perk points, I have decided to implement a training system where players can pay for a training course and gain a certain perk. I would recommend allowing this to be done only between mission times, and limiting only one perk session per rest period. This is left ultimately to the DM, however. One thing to keep in mind is that courses can either be paid for in full, or for a reduced price players can roll for a chance to get the perk. There are three levels to each perk - Basic, Advanced and Master. The greater the level of the perk, the bigger bonus it grants. Perk progression and prerequisites must be followed. Reduced price is 50% of original</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Basic Course: Must roll 15+ to gain perk. Roll affected by Intelligence</li>
			<li>Advanced Course: Must roll 25+ to gain perk. Roll affected by Intelligence</li>
			<li>Master Course: Must roll 30+ to gain perk. Roll affected by Intelligence</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Pariah Gene</h3>
		<p>This is a very special gene that grants the Pariah Effect. Bearers of this gene are nearly immune to elemental spells and have goor resistances to mind spells. They are great psyker killers, as they posess no warp presence at all. They unnerve many people, sometimes even sending weak minds into full blown panic. All psykers and Eldar within 20m of the bearer get -2 to all stats. Everyone else loses 1 for all stats</p>
		<h3>Currency</h3>
		<p>Unfortunately, the Imperim of Man has many forms of currency, the Eldar and Tau have no known currency as everything is either automated or free, hence the need for a unified trading system which the three races can use. Introducing the Union Credits (UC)! Everything upon the world of Unity has been standardised to use these as the currency for exchange, with the Tau and Eldar recognising the need for a common exchange base. Beware though, the underground world can deal in other forms of currency, including souls. Also, while Lord Commander Roboute Guilliman set to tie the UC to other imperial currencies, it is not often accepted on other worlds.</p>
		<h3>Vehicles</h3>
		<p>I have decided to go for a vehicle builder where players get to mix and match chassis, troop capacity, guns, etc. to specific missions, rather than give the choice of a large number of vehicles and their variations that would be very long and difficult to get through. Here is what needs to be remembered about the vehicles: Tau pack less punch but have good long and extreme ranged weaponry, Eldar tech is based on agile combat with medium damage but low durability of tanks, and Imperial vehicles focus on taking and giving the most damage possible. Furthermore, I have left out titans from the vehicle selection list (for now), meaning that players cannot field them. They will however be able to encounter titans as enemies or relic sites.</p>
		<h3>Spells</h3>
		<p>The available lore of the game does not have a lot of content regarding spells, and what is available is difficult to implement at best. Hence I have taken the most liberty with this section, trying to sort everything categories where applicable. Please note that spells use ranged accuracy when applicable. Currently there are the following disciplines of spells than fall under two broad categories - Elemental, mainly used for damage and interactions with the physical world; and Mental, used for interaction with the Immaterium and the mind.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pyromancy (ELemental): effective against low armoured targets as it deals burning damage, or to be used for explosive damage against heavy armour</li>
			<li>Cryomancy (Elemental): provides slowing effects and crowd control options</li>
			<li>Fulmination (Elemental): more useful against tech and complex armours, but deals higher damage than other elemental spells</li>
			<li>Telekinesis (Mental): covers the application of the mind on the physical world, from shielding to translocation of objects</li>
			<li>Telepathy (Mental): covers the mental powers that affect the minds of others, from concealment to mind talk</li>
			<li>Divination (Mental): covers the mental powers that try to discern the future by reading the tides of Warp</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Combat</h3>
		<p>This game is not like the regular D&amp;D game! There is no initiative! Combat is divided into time intervals where you are allowed to undergo actions. Players are encouraged to spend some time before each action period commences to talk out who does what. The DM is advised to limit these discussions as plaayers should have discussed strategy before the battle. Then, everybody makes an action at the same time! This means that the players all do their thing together while the enemy is also performing actions. Essentially think each time interval as a window of 30 seconds. During this you can run around or shoot or reload, etc. Also, when you are directing NPCs into battle, they also need to be directed what to do. I would advise limiting discussions before each action phase to around 5 mins, then each characted states what their character and what their underlings are doing. If no clear decision is made, the character is just left to do nothing.</p>
		<p>Each turn of battle: a summary</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Discussion phase: around 5 mins spent on discussion of tactics and what each friendly character (player / NPC) is doind</li>
			<li>Statement phase: each player states specifically what their character is doing, then what their subordinated are doing. Failiure to do so results in a skipped turn. No discussion allowed. The DM concludes the phase by stating what each enemy unit is doing</li>
			<li>Action Phase: figures move, players roll dice for accuracy, dodge and damage, the DM calls out what the enemy has done, etc.</li>
			<li>New turn if the battle is not over.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Combat is divided into five ranges. They are applicable to both NPCs and tanks alike. Here is the break down of distances:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Melee: hand to hand combat, using daggers, swords, spears, staves and hammers. requires the figures to be in the same square. Not applicable to vehicles</li>
			<li>Close range: 0 to 50 m. Should be used when either trying to get in melee range or for flamethrower-like weapons, or on city terrain and jungle</li>
			<li>Mid range: 50 to 250 m. General range for combat on semi-open grounds like a forest or some city terrain.</li>
			<li>Long range: 250 to 750 m. Few assault rifles can reach that range with good accuracy, this is the domain of sniper fire and long ranged vehicles. Prevailent on open terrain and during large open battles.</li>
			<li>Extreme range: 750+ m. Only some vehicles can accurately fight at such distances, and this is used only outside of cities, preferably with a recon team closer to the target for more accurate fire.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Routing happens when the players or NPCs face odds that are greater than 3 to 1 (squads are counted as single entities), or are affected by a fear spell. Roll is affected by leadership stat of the closest player inc yourself. Routed entities move away from the battle zone until they reach the edge of the field. Each turn they can roll to remove rout. Tanks are affected as well (basically their crew ran away). Nat 1 during rout check means you leave most valuable item behind. Tanks are abandoned if Nat 1 is rolled</p>
		<h3>Character Creation</h3>
		<p>I am sorry to say but the normal pen-and-paper method of creating a character is going to be rather difficult and troublesome. Hence, I have built a creator that does that for you. Please use it, as some skills have formulas associated with them. Also, it keeps track of your damage and ability to hit things, etc. based upon your equips, which I believe will be quite handy. I will keep working and refining it, with the goal eventually having images for everything and maybe even a character customiser with images. Lastly, please use the "Generate Save Code" function, as it lets you close the browser and keep the character without spending a long time remembering what you had.</p>
