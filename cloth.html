		<h3>Runes</h3>
		<p>Runes function as weapon enchantments and are backwards compatible - meaning if the armour can hold one rare rune, you can put in a common or uncommon one instead. Be warned, runes are permanent and can only be improved (common -> uncommon, etc), not interchanged with other runes. Same type runes may be inscribed into an armour</p>

		<h3>Armour Upgrades</h3>
		<p>These are technological upgrades for the armoures. Jetpacks can only be installed on compatible armoures and do not require an upgrade slot. Only a single type of upgrade can be installed per armour. These upgrades are interchangeable</p>
