		<h1>Recruitable Allies</h1>
	</header>
		<br>

	<main>
		<p>All allies will stay with the players until they are either killed or dismissed</p>
		<p>Squads behave as a single entiry and occupy a 10x10 spot. They have a number of people that all need to be equipped with armour and weapons. Ammo is considered unlimited unless it is rockets or grenades. After every mission squads can be refilled at 50% cost.</p>
		<p>Each character has a health value, when squads take damage it is distributed down the line, e.g. a Kasrkin squad taked 10 damage and each man has 3 HP - 3 guardsmen die and the 4th one now has 2 HP left. When squads attack only 1 roll is needed, damage = roll outcome * 0.5 * number of people</p>
		<p>NPCs can be upgraded after a certain number of missions given that an upgrade exists and the squad is full, you pay half the hire price to upgrade the squad. Hired NPCs must be at a lower rank than the players</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Common = C</li>
			<li>Uncommon = U</li>
			<li>Rare = R</li>
			<li>Legendary = L</li>
			<li>Unique = Q</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Close Combat: One Handed = Daggers (D) + Swords (W), Two handed = Spears (R) + Hammers (M) + Staves (S)</p>
		<p>Ranged Combat: One Handed = Daggers (T) + Pistols (P), Two handed = Assault Rifles (A) + Sniper Rifles (N) + Heavy Weapons (H)</p>
