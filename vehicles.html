	</header>
		<br>

	<main>
		<p>There are three parts to this page, the chassis selection which defines what weapons you can use and what armour you have, the amarment selection, and the vehicle upgrades that boost certain aspects of the vehicle.</p>
		<p>Each vehicle needs a pilot and some gunners, depending on the choice of weapons installed. These can be hired from the Allies tab, as players are not encouraged to pilot vehicles or operate their weaponry</p>
		<p>There are four classes of armour in the game for vehicles, each having its own armour rating detailed below. Note that infantry with armour rating of 9 or less is considered unarmoured, armour ratings from 10 to 19 are light armour and 20+ is med armour</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Light Armour: armour rating = 15, health = 10</li>
			<li>Medium Armour: armour rating = 25, health = 15</li>
			<li>Heavy Armour: armour rating = 35, health = 15</li>
			<li>Super Heavy Armour: armour rating = 40, health = 25</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Walkers and Track based vehicles are all in direct contact with the ground, Hover tanks are floating 2m off the ground</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Chassis</h3>
		<p>Where multiple configurations are available, you cannot change between configurations when you have purchased a tank. Key: Config 1 / Config 2 / Config 3</p>

		<h3>Weapons</h3>
		<p>Range for some weapons exceeds line of sight, in shich case a spotter team is recommended to coordinate fire. Some weapons cannot target close targets, so be careful with those tanks as they sometimes have no defence against nearby enemies</p>
		<p>Critical rolls: only if Nat 20, deal double damage</p>
		<p>There are 4 possible slots for guns: Top, Left and Right (2 side), and Front</p>
		<p>Unless otherwise stated, each gun requires 1 gunner to operate, apart from front guns which are operated by the pilot</p>
		<p>The Drone facility produces 1 combat drone every 2 turns, drones last 6 turns</p>
		<p>There are four types of tank weapons in the game, it is assumed that tanks have infinite ammo. It is possible to downgrade weapons, i.e. a large weapon slot can accept small or medium weapons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Small (S): lowest damage dealing weapons, mainly used against infantry</li>
			<li>Medium (M): most common weapons, can be tank and infantry oriented</li>
			<li>Large (L): either deal damage in a large area or deal a lot of damage against tanks</li>
			<li>Super Large (U): few tanks can even hold these massive weapons, they are mostly tank killers, some even packing the punch to attack titans</li>
		</ul>
