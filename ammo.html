		<h3>Weapon Upgrades</h3>
		<p>Only one of each type of upgrade is allowed. Heavy weapons cannot be upgraded</p>
		<p>Low light levels reduce ranged accuracy by 50%; vision clouding effects like fog or smoke reduce visibility range to 20m, beyond which ranged accuracy = 0</p>
		<p>Pistols and assault rifles are noticable when fired from 50 m away, snipers and heavy weapons are noticeable from 100m away</p>
