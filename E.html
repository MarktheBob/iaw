		<h1>Eldar</h1>
		<h2>An ancient and mysterious race</h2>
	</header>

	<main>
		<h3>Background and Playstyle</h3>
		<p>Eldar are an ancient race. They have been created by the Old Ones and remember the Necrons even before they went in their stasis sleep. As such, they have had many millenia to come up with and perfect combat styles, tactics and strategy. However, due to overindulgence the once mighty race has managed to create the fourth Chaos God, Slaanesh. Now they hide in the remaining Craftworlds, fending off many menaces, including their renegade brothers, the Dark Eldar.
			<br>
		The Eldar have organised their troops into certain shrines, each founded by a mighty Phoenix Lord, and each represents a facet of warfare. For example, the Fire Dragons wield fusion guns that reduce tanks and armour to slag, while Warp Spiders use death spinners to shred lightly armourd enemies to pieces. There are also Seers, powerful psykers that can sometimes look the future, and the mysterious Harlequins, storytellers and excellent combatants. Aided by the everpresent Webway, the Eldar are a powerful force in the Galaxy, but a slowly dying one.
			<br>
		All Eldar posess psychic abilities, but not many have great talents in that area. Overall, most Eldar wander between Aspect Shrines, never fully commiting to the P{ath of the Warrior. Then again, such individuals are not members of the regular army. As there are many shrines to choose from, each specialising in its own path, those Eldar who commit to the Path can reach great heights, becoming even more fearsome than the most powerful of Space Marines, especially given their relative fraility. After all, legends say that Maugan Ra, the Phoenix Lord of Dark Reapers has once singlehandedly defended a Craftworld from the Tyranid Invasion.
		</p>
		<h3>Military Structure</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Craftworld: the mobile home among the stars, it is governed by a Council of Farseers with the aid of an Autarch</li>
			<li>Squad: a small group of warriors of the same path, led by an Exarch. There are no larger military groups, as the autarch can either grant full autonomy or direct all squads simultaneously</li>
			<li>Masque: led by the masque leader, aided by a shadowseer and a death jester. Sometimes a Solitaire joins the masque, but has no permanent place amongst it. Has three troupes</li>
			<li>Troupe: a band of harlequins, led by a troupe master</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Notable Aspect Shrines</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Dire Avengers: versatile combatants that are the most numerous of the Eldar troops. Specialise in daggers, pistols and assault rifles</li>
			<li>Dark Reapers: slower and heavier armoured than other troops, these warriors prefer long ranged combat and heavy weapons. Specialise in daggers, assault rifles and heavy weapons</li>
			<li>Warp Spiders: fast attack units, always ready to appear anywhere on the battlefield to shred the enemies. Specialise in pistols, daggers and assault rifles. Exarchs and above can use jet packs</li>
			<li>Howling Banshees: fearsome close combat warriors that induce terror on their opponents. Specialise in pistols, swords and daggers. Exarchs and above can use spears</li>
			<li>Rangers: while not technically having shrines, the path of a ranger is similar to that of other warriors. These hunters prefer sniper combat to close ranged battle. Specialise in daggers, pistols and sniper rifles</li>
		</ul>

				<p>Gain proficiency in swords.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Seer Initiate</h3>
				<p>If a particular Eldar has a strong psichic gift they are chosen to be trained as a Seer, an equivalent of an imperial psyker but posessing much greater strength.</p>
				<p>Lose proficiency in assault rifles, gain proficiency in staves and spears. Psyker Path</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Exarch</h3>
				<p>After many battles the eldar can master the path to a certain degree, thus becoming an Exarch, a leader of a squad of your aspect bretheren.</p>
				<p>+1 Constitution</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Harlequin</h3>
				<p>A full member of the troupe, knowledgeable both in dance and combat. A fearsome warrior, sometimes being able to best a Space Marine in direct combat. Gain proficiency in spears.</p>
				<p>+1 Agility</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Seer</h3>
				<p>As the initiate seer gains more control over their powers they become a full seer, able to wield their gift with greater efficiency.</p>
				<p>+1 Intelligence</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Shrine Master</h3>
				<p>Once the exarch has experienced many battles they gain an even deeper understanding into their chosen path, thus being elevated to represent a particular shrine in the Craftworld. Can offer advice to the Autarch on the intricacies of the represented path in the thick of battle.</p>
				<p>+1 Constitution</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Troupe Master</h3>

				<p>+1 Intelligence</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Aspect Lord</h3>

				<p>+1 Constitution AND Warp Resistance</p>
			</div>
			<div>

				<p>+1 Agility AND Strength</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Solitaire</h3>
				<p>Foregoing companionship of their fellow harlequins, solitaires become lone wanderers in the Webway. Although they are the fiercest warriors of all harlequins, they rarely battle alongside any due to a Pariah aura, similar to Culexus assasins. Some say that the harlequin god himself, Cegorach, walks the Webway wearing the robes of a solitaire.</p>

				<p>+2 Intelligence</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Wraithlord / Wraithguard</h3>
				<p>Sometimes death is not the end for some Eldar. An aspect warrior or a Seer can render great military achievements such that after death their spirit stone may be placed in a suit of wraithbone to further aid the defences of the craftworld. It is impossible for a harlequin wraithguard to exist since their souls are pledged to their god, hence they wear no spirit stones.</p>
