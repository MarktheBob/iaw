		<h1>Adeptus Sororitas</h1>
		<h2>Fearless Sisters of Battle</h2>
	</header>
	<main>
		<h3>Background and Playstyle</h3>
		<p>Sisters of Battle were originally called Daughters of the Emperor, an all-female division of the Imperial Ecclesiarchy. After the M36 Age of Apostacy they were officially recognised and accepted as the core strength of the Ecclesiarchy, essentially being the feminine version of the Space Marines, but not having any genetic modifications.
			<br>
		These warriors are picked from regular imperial citisens, so they cannot posess any psykers. However, being fanatically devoted to the Emperor himself, they have high resistance to the corruptive powers of Chaos.
			<br>
		On the battlefield sisters are engaged in medium and close ranged combat, bearing melee weapons and rifle style weapons. Given enough training they can weild heavy weapons like heavy flamers and missile launchers. Some sisters are assigned for fast assault tactics, wearing jet packs to boost into the heart of enemy forces.
		</p>
		<h3>Military Structure</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Order: led by Canoness Superior, has several perceptories</li>
			<li>Perceptory: led by a prioress, has up to 1000 sisters divided into commanderies and is equivalent to a Space Marine Chapter</li>
			<li>Commandery: led by a canoness, has up to 200 sisters divided into missions and is equivalent to a Space Marine Company</li>
			<li>Mission: led by a palatine sister, has up to 50 sisters divided onto squads</li>
			<li>Squad: led by a sister superior, has up to 10 battle sisters</li>
		</ul>

			<div>
				<h3>Battle Sister</h3>
				<p>The entry rank of the sisterhood. Does not have any special training.</p>
				<p>Proficient in pistols, assault rifles, swords and daggers</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Sister Superior</h3>
				<p>After several years in the service, a sister is elevated to the rank of a Sister Superior, an equivalent of a sargeant in other forces.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Palatine Sister</h3>
				<p>A fierce warrior that leads other sisters into battles, is a senior rank among the Sororitas. They are qualified to make decisions on the battlefield and generally are assigned broad mission objectives to be interpreted by themselves.</p>
				<p>Gain proficciency in hammers.</p>
				<p>+1 Strength</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Dominion Sister</h3>
				<p>These sisters forego the training in close combat, instead coosing to bear heavy weaponry. They provide support on the battlefield through greater firepower, reinforcing and attacking key areas.</p>
				<p>Lose proficiency in swords, gain proficiency in heavy weapons.</p>
				<p>+1 Marksmanship</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Canoness</h3>
				<p>Comannds one of the Orders Militant and has risen through the ranks of the sisters by participating in many battles, while also having extreme tactical and strategical knowledge, as well as immense faith in the emperor. Can sometimes be the seniormost sister on the planet, if the threat was deemed not too large, so a large degree of autonomy can sometimes be expected.</p>
				<p>+1 Strength</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Seraphim Sister</h3>
				<p>Those sisters that decide to forego the leadership positions, instead preferring to wage combat in the heart of the enemy become seraphims. They prefer close combat to ranged combat, but still carry some pistols and rifles to engage the enemy as they approach.</p>
				<p>Gain proficiency in jetpacks.</p>
				<p>+2 Agility</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Dominion Sister Superior</h3>
				<p>Once the sister has shown remarkable heay weapons abilities, as well as some leadership qualities, she may now command a squad of dominion sisters. Due to there not being many such squads in a commandery, the canoness values their opinions on the overall strategy of the battle. They are given somedegrees of freedom to interpret the situations and direct much needed firepower to key locations on the field of battle.</p>
				<p>+1 Marksmanship</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Prioress</h3>
				<p>After many years of service these sisters now command perceptories, which are often dispatched to deal with large infestations of chaos or xenos. Is expected to be autonomous and make many decisions on the tactics and strategy.</p>
				<p>+1 Strength AND Constitution</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Seraphim Sister Superior</h3>
				<p>Due to large ammounts of training needed to become a seraphim, those who command these squads are often as knowledgeable as canonesses in terms of tactics and strategy. They offer much needed advice to the leader of the mission and can sometimes command other squads from the heart of battle.</p>
				<p>+1 Agility</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Celestian Sister</h3>
				<p>The right hand of the mission leader, be it  canoness or a prioress, they have extensive knowledge not only on the heavy weapons in which they specialise, but in tactics and strategy. Can sometimes direct the battle if the mission leader is otherwise preoccupied.</p>
				<p>+2 Marksmanship</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Living Saint</h3>
				<p>Death is not the end for some sisters. Some high ranked sisters can become these unkillable beings infused with the Emperor's will. All sisters will follow them unquestionably, as they emit a holy aura that protects those around them.</p>
