	<p class = "subtitle2">Introduction:</p>
	<p class = "story">M42. The High Lords of Terra were confronted by a mysterius figure during one of their meetings and ordered to ally with Tau and Eldar, as otherwise doom will come to the Empire of Man. The figure then dissappeared. It is believed that the remnants of the Emperor's spirit have awoken, since the readings from Golden's Throne machinery showed increasing signs of activity. Soon, news arrived of Abbadon's new Dark Crusade launching from the Eye of Terror, followed by distant sightings of another Tyranid Hive fleet coming in from the northern edge of the galaxy. High Lords were forced to take action and send emissaries to Tau and Eldar.</p>
	<p class = "story">Surprisingly, Eldar have already begun building a peace world, where the three races may co-exist and plan their co-operative attacks and defence strategies. Apparently, the Farseers recieved visions of a terrible future, and backed up with the message from the Laughing God, Eldar had to learn how to collaborate with lesser races. Tau soon arrived onto the scene as the Etherial Council directed the Water Caste to make contact with both Eldar and Imperium for the Greater Good.</p>
	<p class = "story">Soon talks began between all three races, and after much haggling, threats and appeals, a peace treaty was signed to last until the Eye of Terror is closed, the remnants of Tyranids have been slain and Necrons finally put to rest. The peace world is to become the training grounds for new regiments consisting of Tau fire warriors, Space Marines, Eldar and Imperial Solders. After hostilities died down to an acceptable level and separatists dealt with, hope began to emerge as all three races saw that they only enhances the abilities of each other.</p>
	<p class = "story">Eldar are natural psykers. Being the eldest race, they are masters of magic and weapons. However, they are few in numbers and their warriors are difficult to train to become masters of their Path.</p>
	<p class = "story">Space Marines and Sisters of Battle are warriors to the core, using powerful technology to enhance their already modified bodies to become elite fighters. Unfortunately they cannot see into the future as Eldar do and lack the scouting capabilities of the Tau.</p>
	<p class = "story">Tau warriors are scouts and snipers, being able to take enemies from afar, while using battlesuits to diversify their tactics and achieving very high mobility and tactical flexibility. But they cannnot perform magic and have no access to the Warp, thus lacking fast space travel and psykers.</p>
	<p class = "story">Common Imperial solders were very helpful of bridging the gap between races, their inability to specialise and humour (once they got over the fear of Tau and Eldar) made them perfect for becoming the regiments' glue, holding teams together. Also, their high numbers and expendibility, plus the ease of training made them the most common solders within inter-race squads.</p>
	<p class = "story">Now Mundum Congregatium, the new peace world, is a place where humanoids from all three Races train and live together, fighting for a greater cause. Space Marine Chapters send some of their recruits here o train with novice fire warriors from Tau, recruits into the Imperium army and aspect initiates from the Eldar. New battle groups started to form, consisting of all races' representatives trained together as one unit.</p>

<p class = "story"><sup>1</sup>This game will (probably) not be in accordance with the lore of Warhammer 40k, as it is nearly impossible to make a D&ampD style game with current lore. Hence I have moved the events forward into M42 so this game can actually function without breaking. Most information was found on <a href = "http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Main_Page" target = "_blank">Lexicanum</a>, thanks to all of its authors and contributors for updating and publishing.</p>
