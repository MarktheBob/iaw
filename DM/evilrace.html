	<p class = "story"><a href = "chaos.html">Chaos Space Marines</a> are traitor chapters that rebelled against the Emperor in M30, leading to the civil war of Imperium. They were defeated then, and retreated to the Eye of Terror, into the realm of the Chaos Gods. Abbadon the Defiler, the Warmaster of Chaos Marines is their current 'leader'. Chaos seeks to destroy Imperium and kill the Emperor, conquering all the worlds and offering its people as sacrifices to their gods. They, along with demons, initiate cults which may lead do demonic invasions onto planets. Occasional raids by Chaos Marines also occur.</p>
	<p class = "story"><a href = "necron.html">Necron</a> are an ancient race that existed even before the Eldar. They were once humanoids but they declared war on the Old Ones and were defeated and confined to a dark sun far away. In that sun Necrontyr discovered the C'Tan, Star Gods, with whom they made a deal. This resulted in a conversion from flesh to living metal and the creation of the Necron. The tides changed and now with the aid of C'Tan Necrons were able to finally defeat and destroy the Old Ones. Necrons suffered heavy losses and retreated to tomb worlds, to sleep until the time will come to once again roam this galaxy and kill all the living races, creations of their foes, the Old Ones.</p>
	<p class = "story"><a href = "orcs.html">Orcs</a> are strange creatures that love war. They are spread thoughout all of the galaxy, and are more numerous than all other races. They fight anything that moves and occasionally things that don't, but are extremely difficult to eradicate. Orks can be considered as fungi, as they spread trough spores, but in reality they are symbiotes and the whole ecosystem can be made of entirely Orkoid creatures. Rumored to be created by the Old Ones, Orks spread out gradually but steadily, warring everyone and everything.</p>
	<p class = "story"><a href = "tyranid.html">Tyranids</a> come from the nearby galaxy, and so far we have only seen and felt the tip of the iceberg. It is unknown how many galaxies they have previously consumed, but the giant hive, The Great Devourer, is currently heading this way, sending small tendrils to pre-colonise worlds and weaken any opposition. Having a hive mind, tyranids are unified under one controller, and adding the ability to mutate over days, makes them very formidable foes. They have no technology, but multiple mutations provide them with everything from acid rifles to living spaceships to tunneling plants, which can reach the magma layers of the planet. However, since the will of The Great Devourer cannot transmit over millions of light years, controllers have to be made on the spot, so killing them will make all tyranids mindless and uncontrollable.</p>
	<p class = "story"><a href = "darkeldar.html">Dark Eldar</a> inhabit the mysterious Webway, with their base being the dark and terrible city of Commorragh, ruled by Asdrubael Vect. They raid the material space for victims as the only way to prolong their lives is to extract pain from victims, regardless of their origin, occasionally bringing their brothers, Eldar, as well. Massive arenas belonging to different Kabals and Wych Cults provide entertainment and energy to the forever hungry Dark Eldar. Being in a secluded spot of the Webway, the only ones that can come and go freely are the Harlequins, others will be used for entertainment until their deaths.</p>
