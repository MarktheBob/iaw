		<h1>Imperial Guard</h1>
		<h2>Common soldiers in service to the Emperor</h2>
	</header>

	<main>
		<h3>Background and Playstyle</h3>
		<p>The Empire of man has many tousands of worlds each housing trillions of citisens. Evidently the Imperial Guard, or as it is officially known, Astra Militarum is quite expendible. It also follows that all who serve there are very very different. Overall, the men and women that serve in the guard are highly adaptable to many things, including corruption. Hence, the comissariate was established, to watch over the troops and prevent heresey from spreading.
			<br>
		Alongside the guardsmen serve the psykers. While not as powerful as the librarians of the Space Marines, nor the Seers of the Eldar, if enough psykers pile in their powers some devastating spells could be wrought. Separate of the Astra Militarum command structure lies the Inquisition. While they are separate, they can still command even the planetary governors and generals given enough justification. And in the shadows exists the Oficio Assasinatorum, the empire's spies and assasins. They recruit future members in secret from the regular guardsmen to then train them into deadly weapons.
		<br>
		The Guard and its associates are a very flexible collection of talents, not specialising in any particular mode of combat as a whole. While not as strong as the Astartes or the Sorotitas, they posess good strength and vitality to survive in many environments. While not as attuned to the Warp as the Eldar, they have the strength in numbers to overwhelm even the most powerful of the Seers, should the need arise. And while not as good of marksmen as the Tau, they still are compenet enough to hit targets even in the long range. Guardsmen are also fast learners, otherwise they would have long since been dead, for the Imperium does not care for the casualties amongst the Guard.

			<li>Vindicare: masters of long range assasination and patience, they are often in position miles away days before the target even gets there. Specialise in daggers, pistols and sniper rifles</li>

				<p>Proficiencies outlined above.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Sanctionite</h3>

				<p>+1 Constitution</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Acolyte</h3>
				<p>When an inquisitor needs to fill his retinue, they do not need useless cadets. As an acolyte it is expected of them to collect information and investigate for traps so that the inquisitor may not die too quickly.</p>
				<p>+1 Warp Resistance</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Assasin</h3>
				<p>Those novices that survive training are now full members of the temples. They are assigned missionsby their masters, to be carried out solo or in groups.</p>
				<p>+1 Agility</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Aspirant</h3>
				<p>Now more in control of their powers, psykers are watched less closely and can sometimes be allowed to roam without supervision.</p>
				<p>+1 Intelligence</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Captain</h3>

				<p>Gain proficiency in hammers.</p>
				<p>+1 Constitution</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Comissar</h3>
				<p>After leading men to battle for years, some begin to notice that some types of soldiers are more brave, while others like to shirk their duties. Such leutenants are selected to become comissars, watchdogs of the imperium on the field of battle, ensuring than no man flees from duty to the Empire.</p>
				<p>+1 Warp Resistance</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Inquisitor</h3>
				<p>Being an inquisitor is a difficult task, having many priveleges but also many duties. Being the secret police of the Imperium, they hunt both the archives and the streets for heretic cults and xenos informers. Generally Inquisitors build up their teams even before taking on the role, making connections and planting informers, for the hunt is hard and the colleagues mmay not be trustful of you.</p>
				<p>Gain proficiency in hammers</p>
				<p>+1 Warp Resistance</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Master Assasin</h3>
				<p>Overseeing several regular members of the temples and receiving missions from their grandmaster is a challenging task, especially since a failed attempt can be catastrophic. Hence, master assasins are indeed masters of their craft, not shying away from difficult missions as sometimes no regular members can successfully complete them.</p>
				<p>+1 Agility</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Savant Warrant</h3>
				<p>A psyker that has already served on the field of battle and proven themselves to be in control of their powers can now go without supervision and can sometimes be asked to direct a choir of lower psykers on the battlefield. These psykers also have some understanding of tactics as they help captains and other officers plan the course of action.</p>
				<p>Gain proficiency in spears</p>
				<p>+1 Intelligence</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Colonel</h3>
				<p>When a captain shows deep knowledge of both tactics and strategy, they are sometimes promoted to a Colonel, to oversee and plan for the whole regiment. Of course, they still have to take orders from generals, Astartes officers and the like, colonels enjoy a great degree of autonomy, especially if they are sent on a mission by themselves.</p>
				<p>+1 Strength AND Constitution</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Senior Comissar</h3>
				<p>The right hand of the colonel, the senior comissar is responsible for the morale of the regiment as well as advising the colonel on some of the dangers of the mission should the regiment encounter xenos enemies or heretics.</p>
				<p>+1 Strength AND Warp Resistance</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Lord Inquisitor</h3>
				<p>Such titles are not given lightly, for the inquisitor must first prove themselves in multiple investigations and scenarios, and remain alive and fiercly loyal to the Empire. They still have a small and trusted retinue, but their connections can span sectors. Still, some other lords with very opposing viewpoints can be hostile, but not openly for all inquisitors serve the Imperium.</p>
				<p>+2 Warp Resistance</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Grandmaster Assasin</h3>
				<p>Those surviving masters can then become grandmasters after many more missions and years of service. They are given a lot of autonomy in mission delegation, and while they rarely go out, their skill are on par with the best in the entire temple.</p>
				<p>+2 Agility</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Perceptor Savant</h3>
				<p>A powerful psyker tasked with protecting important officers and with directing the other psykers in the regiment. While having roughly the same power as a Codicer Librarian, these psykers can link up with all the psykers in the regiment to cast spells of great powers, rivalling that of Eldar Farseers and Space Marine Epistolaries.</p>
				<p>+2 Intelligence</p>
