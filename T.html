		<h1>Tau</h1>
		<h2>A young race determined to spread the Greater Good</h2>
	</header>

	<main>
		<h3>Background and Playstyle</h3>
		<p>A very young race that only spent just over six millenia to master spacecraft from the stone age. They are divided into castes, each caste assigned certain tasks to perform. The Fire caste are the soldiers, Water is responsible for merchant and diplomatic duties, Earth consists of builders, Air being pilots and messengers and the Etherials leading them towards the Greater Good.
			<br>
		Tau are cautios and patient warriors, preferring indepth planning to straight up charging the enemy. After all, being masters of long ranged combat, they have no need for such foolish tactics. That does however pose a problem, for should it some to hand to hand combat the Tau are exceptionally poor at staying alive. There was an old imperial account of a company of 300 imperial soldiers facing a cadre of 100 fire warriors. Only a single squad survived the charge to the Tau lines. The Tau were slaughtered to the last.
			<br>
		Being a highly technologically advanced race, they employ many drones to help with their strategies, ranging from protective shield drones to rail rifpe sniper drones. Their weaponry is exclusively medium to long ranged, and their best snipers are considered the deadliest in the galaxy.
			<br>
		One curious thing about the Tau is that they have almost no Warp presence. This is not even remotely similar to the Pariah gene, but this ensures that not only can they have no psykers, but they also cannot travel the Warp by themselves, lacking astropaths and navigators present in the Imperium. However, this does make them imprevious to chaotic corruption and quite resistant to spells.

			<li>Cadre: led by a commander, consists of several squads of regular Fire Warriors and battlesuit squadrons.</li>
			<li>Fire Warrior Squad: consists of around 10 to 20 regular warriors led by a veteran or a hero.</li>

			<div>
				<h3>Fire Warrior</h3>
				<p>The core of the Tau army, they have passed basic training but are still not experienced enough in Tau tactics and strategemes to lead.</p>
				<p>Proficient in assault rifles and pistols, reduced penalty when using daggers.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Veteran Fire Warrior</h3>
				<p>A more experienced Tau warrior, they are generally in command of single squads of regular warriors. Are expected to perform their set tasks but need to have enough knowledge to adapt to the situation if something changes in the plan.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Scout</h3>
				<p>Part of a smaller squad, scouts operate further from the main forces of the Tau, occasionally marking targets, occasionally aiding the front lines from afar with sniper rifles.</p>
				<p>Add proficiency with sniper rifles, take reduced penalty when using assault rifles.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Fire Warrior Hero</h3>
				<p>A formidable warrior that generally accompanies a commander as part of his retinue, or leads a squad of fire warriors into key positions during a battle.</p>
				<p>Add proficiency in daggers.</p>
				<p>+1 Marksmanship</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Hunter</h3>
				<p>As a leader of a scout squad much independant thought is required for this position. Scouts can be sent on missions for weeks at a time without contact with the main base as they scout for information used in the planning of a battle.</p>
				<p>Add proficiency in daggers.</p>
				<p>+1 Agility</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Fire Warrior Knight</h3>
				<p>Part of the immediate surroundings of a commander, they advise them during the planning of a battle. During battle act as second-in-commands, making split second decisions should the disposition of enemies suddenly change.</p>
				<p>Take lower penalty with swords.</p>
				<p>+1 Marksmanship</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>XV15 Stealthsuit Pilot</h3>
				<p>Only very experienced scouts can be granted the honour of donning the XV15, as these suits drastically improve the stealth abilities of the pilot, blending into the surroundings. Several pilots will then be sent behind enemy lines to perform acts of sabotage and even assasination while the main army readies for an attack. Much independance is required of these pilots, as they must adapt rapidly to the situation, or die</p>
				<p>Add proficiency with assault rifles.</p>
				<p>+1 Agility</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Fire Warrior Commander</h3>
				<p>The leader of a cadre, is generally the senior most officer in a campaign or operation. While being a brilliant tactitian, the commander is also one of the most deadly warriors on the battlefield, cabable of using a variety of weapons for great effect.</p>
				<p>Add proficiency with swords, take lower penalty with heavy weapons.</p>
				<p>+2 Marksmanship</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>XV8 Crisis Pilot</h3>
				<p>Oftentimes being a pilot of this suit is the highest honour for a Tau, as this is a Tau equivalent of a Space Marine Terminator. Highly versatile and equipped with heavy weapons, this suit can change the course of battle in seconds of deployment.</p>
				<p>Add proficiency in heavy weapons and swords, lose proficiency in daggers, pistols and assault rifles.</p>
				<p>+2 Marksmanship</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>XV25 Stealthsuit Pilot</h3>
				<p>The best of stealth technology that is available to the Tau is used to make this suit. Used for solo missions deep into enemy camps, pilots who wear these suits perform a crusial role in Tau assaults. Rarely do they operate in squads, and then the damage done to the enemy is massive even before the battle truly begins.</p>
				<p>Take lower penalty with heavy weapons.</p>
				<p>+1 Marksmanship AND Agility</p>
